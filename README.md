# WWCode-TDD-KATA

This starter code is a simple spring boot server with an endpoint "/" to return a Roman Numeral from a number. 
In this workshop, we are not going to cover anything about Spring Boot. But after we finish TDD converting number to Roman Numeral,
we will test on localhost server. 

For example: 
* "locahost:8080/2" will give us "II" on the page
* "locahost:8080/9" will give us "IX" on the page

## Download the start code to your local directory
Go to the folder where you want to download the project

Run `git clone https://github.com/XuqiuyeLi/WWCode-TDD-KATA.git`

## How to run the server 
Go to the project folder on command line

Run `./gradlew bootRun`



### Thanks for coming!
